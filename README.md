# Learn TypeScript with Me 🚀

Welcome to my **TypeScript learning journey**! 🎯 This repository is my personal space for mastering TypeScript, covering everything from **basics to advanced** concepts. If you're also learning TypeScript, feel free to join in! 🤝

## 📌 Why TypeScript?
TypeScript is a **powerful** superset of JavaScript that adds **static typing, interfaces, and better tooling** support. It helps in catching errors early and writing scalable code. Since I'm transitioning my React and Node.js projects to TypeScript, this repo will document everything I learn! 💡

## 📚 What You'll Find Here
✅ TypeScript Fundamentals (Types, Interfaces, Functions, etc.)  
✅ Object-Oriented Programming with TypeScript  
✅ Advanced Concepts (Generics, Decorators, Utility Types)  
✅ TypeScript with React & Node.js  
✅ Best Practices & Design Patterns  
✅ Hands-on Projects & Exercises  

## 📖 Learning Roadmap
1. **Getting Started** - Setting up TypeScript, Compiler Options, and Configuration 🛠️
2. **Basic Types** - Strings, Numbers, Arrays, Tuples, Enums, and Any vs Unknown
3. **Functions & Interfaces** - Type Safety, Optional Parameters, and Function Overloading
4. **Advanced TypeScript** - Generics, Mapped Types, Utility Types, and Type Guards
5. **OOP with TypeScript** - Classes, Interfaces, and Inheritance
6. **TypeScript in React & Node.js** - Practical Implementation
7. **Best Practices** - Clean Code, Error Handling, and Performance Optimization
